				The 2.5-mile-long central section of Las Vegas Boulevard, which runs through the city from northeast to southwest, known as the Strip, is where the action is. Lined with huge entertainment palaces, many built with a defining theme, and home to performance venues, luxury hotel rooms, and fine dining, this is what most people think of when they picture Las Vegas.

One of the must-do's in Las Vegas is walking along the Strip and soaking up the sights. It's particularly impressive at night, when the city is illuminated by an endless succession of glittering neon signs. This area is a never-ending feast for the senses.

Generally speaking, the Las Vegas Strip runs from the Mandalay Bay Hotel to Treasure Island Hotel. To truly experience Las Vegas, stay on The Strip, preferably at one of the major resorts.

				<br/><br/>
				The Mob Museum, or the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement as it is officially named, is a truly unique and standout museum in Nevada. The museum is housed in a 1933 Neoclassical building, formerly the US Post Office and Courthouse, that has its own history. It was one of the locations for the famous Kefauver Committee hearings in 1950, which revealed some ugly truths about organized crime in Las Vegas and across the US. The museum tells the unvarnished history of the Mob in America through engaging, interactive displays and video clips. Exhibits deal with everything from the individual characters and events to the culture and fashion associated with the times.

				The bright and colorful neon signs of Las Vegas have been one of the city's most memorable sights for countless visitors throughout the years. These multi-story advertising beacons became one of the city's claims to fame. Today, the Neon Museum is working hard to preserve some of the city's history by purchasing, storing, and in some cases, refurbishing the historic neon signs that have gone by the wayside as businesses have faded or new signs have taken the place of older icons. You can see many of these signs by taking a guided tour at the Neon Museum, where old neon signs are stored outside in a large compound. Guides provide the history of the signs and designs, which have evolved over the years.

				Another distinctive theme hotel, at the far southwest end of the Strip, is the Luxor Hotel. Designed in an ancient Egyptian theme, the hotel is shaped like a pyramid, with a sphinx proudly gazing out over the street. The Luxor, like all the major resorts, offers a wide variety of restaurants and shopping opportunities. One of the standout features of this hotel is the beam of light that projects from the highest point of the pyramid and shoots up into the night sky. It can be seen from almost anywhere in Las Vegas.

				The Stratosphere Tower is an unmistakable sight on the Las Vegas skyline. The tower rises up 1,149 feet, and at the very top is the Skypod, the real attraction for visitors. From the various levels of the Skypod, you'll find a whole host of things to do. These include a variety of heart-pounding thrill rides, including the SkyJump, Big Shot, X Scream, and Insanity. For those looking for a little less drama, check out the indoor and outdoor observation decks with great views over the city. The Top of the World Restaurant is a great place to grab an excellent meal while soaking up the views of the Las Vegas Strip off in the distance.
